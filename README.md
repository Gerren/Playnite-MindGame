# Playnite-MindGame
Don't you know what to play? Look no more. This [Playinte](https://playnite.link/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/)) extension will help you find a game.

If you remember [Akinator](https://en.akinator.com/) (yes, it still exists), this extension will let you ask simple questions, and it will narrow down your endless collection of games.

Features:
* You can set multiple fields such as Completion Status, Genre, Tags, Features our your own Category to be asked about
* You can ignore specified values. The Mind Game will never speak of them again.
* You can either use your abundant library in its entirety, or use your filters
* If you don't mind the given criteria you can either say "I don't mind", which will exclude the question for the session, or just Pick Another, which just gives another game with another question.
